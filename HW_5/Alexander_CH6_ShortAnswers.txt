Chapter 6: Multidimensional Arrays, Short Answer Questions (1, 2) -

1.) What is the problem with two-dimensional arrays in C/C++?

    Answer: Two-dimensional arrays were not created with C in mind as C was created to build operating systems, so when you try to pass a 
    two dimensional array to a function the dimensions of that array have to be specified when compiled. This would mean that one program 
    can only handle one set of dimensions at a time.

2.) Describe two ways to work around C/C++'s problems with two-dimensional arrays?
    
    Answer: One way to work around the problems with two-dimensional arrays is to flatten the array where the data becomes stored in a one 
    dimensional array with rows laid end to end. Another method is to use the Numerical Recipes trick where you use two arrays. You start
    with a flat array then create an array of pointers where each pointer points to the start of a row located in the flat array.
