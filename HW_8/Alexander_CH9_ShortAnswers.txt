Chapter 9: Memory Management, Short Answer Questions (2, 5, 8, 12, 13) -

2.) Describe ownership management as it pertains to C++ memory management.

    Answer: In C++ ownership management is done by assigning an object as the owner of a 
    piece of data. That makes it so the owner is responsible for also deleting the data 
    when a pointer is passed to it as long as that object becomes the owner.
     

5.) What is wrong with the following code?

    Car& Factory::makeACar() {

        Car c;
        return c;
    }	
    
    Answer: The code is attempting to return a reference to a local variable that is a 
    part of the stack memory so it will go out of scope and the reference will have 
    nothing to point to. 

8.) What is the difference between copying and moving an object?

    Answer: Copying an object will copy all values of the original object and create a new
    one that is the exact same as the original. Moving an object transfers the ownership
    by copying the pointers of the original while changing the original so that it loses 
    ownership.

12.) When would you need to use a forwards declaration? 
    
    Answer: Forward declarations are used when multiple classes are used in a single 
    program and the compiler needs to know about all the classes. Using an #include header
    within a header file will result in an infinite recursion so programmers use a forward
    declaration instead by writing something like "class X;" within the header file.

13.) What is wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?

    class Part;

    class Whole {

    private:
        Part p;

    public:
        Whole();
        virtual -Whole();

    } // end of Whole class

    Answer: The code is implementing a forward declaration for the class "Part", but 
    forward declarations are used for pointers or references. This would need to use an 
    "#include Part.h" statement instead.
