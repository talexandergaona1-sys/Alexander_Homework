Chapter 8: Getting Started With C++, Short Answer Questions (1, 2, 3, 5, 10) -

1.) What is wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?

    #ifndef PROJECTILE_H
    #define PROJECTILE_H

    class Projectile {

    private:
        double position;
        double velocity;

    public:
        Projectile(double position, double velocity);
        virtual ~Projectile();

        double getPosition() const;
        double getVelocity() const;

    } // end of Projectile class

    #endif

    Answer: The code above is missing the very important semicolon after the curly brace to 
    end the class, need to add ";" to avoid errors.

2.) The following is the definition of the constructor for the Projectile class above, but 
    there are three things wrong with it. What are they and how would you fix them?

    Projectile(int position, int velocity) {
        this.position = position;
        this.velocity = velocity;

    } // end of constructor
    
    Answer: The code uses the incorrect operator to access pointers and is instead using 
    the operator to access objects, it should instead be this->position & this->velocity. 
    It also uses int in the parameters but the variables were both delcared as doubles in 
    the class. Finally, it is missing the 'Projectile::' to indicate which class it belongs 
    to.

3.) Describe each of the following methods:
    (a) int* method(int* arg);
    (b) const int* method(int* arg);
    (c) const int* const method(int* arg);
    (d) const int* const method(const int* arg);
    (e) const int* const method(const int* arg) const;

    Answer: (a) Takes a pointer to an int and returns a pointer to an int
    	    (b) Takes a pointer to an int and retuns a pointer to a const int
    	    (c) Takes a pointer to an int and returns a const pointer to a const int
    	    (d) Takes a pointer to a const int and returns a const pointer to a const int
    	    (e) Takes a pointer to a const int and returns a const pointer to a const int 
	    and includes a trailing const keeping the method from modifying any variables 
	    of the class it belongs to.

5.) What is the difference between a pointer and a reference?
    
    Answer: References are automatically dereferenced, after a reference is initialized it 
    cannot change what it points to, and when a reference is declared it has to be 
    initialized to point to a valid variable.

10.) Why would you never declare a method like this?
        
        void method(const int value);
    
    Answer: The const in the parameter is unnecessary. When a primitive value (int) is 
    passed the function will get a copy of the original variable so const will only affect 
    the local copy.
