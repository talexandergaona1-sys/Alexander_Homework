Chapter 7: Libraries, Short Answer Questions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) -

1.) What are libraries good for?

    Answer: Libraries are good for including and compiling previously created code with 
    many object files into your own program in an easy/intuitive way from a single file.

2.) What are the two types of libraries and how are they different?

    Answer: The first type of library is a static library that is included in the program as 
    if it were a part of the executable source code negating the need to include the 
    library file. The second type is a shared object library that is separate from the 
    program and is loaded in when the program executes allowing for one copy of the library 
    to be included across multiple programs.

3.) Why is it better to get a library from a package manager rather than compile it from 
    source yourself? When might it be better to compile a library yourself?

    Answer: Package managers keep libraries up to date and compatible with each other 
    preventing a user from including two different versions of a library in one program or 
    failing to include the dependencies of each. 

4.) Suppose you are on macOS and you want to use a library in the file 
    /usr/local/lib/libpng.dylib that has the accompanying header file 
    /usr/local/include/png.h. Suppose also that your program consists of one file called 
    main.cc. Write the makefile for this project.

    Answer: CXX = g++

	    CXXFLAGS = -I/usr/local/include       # Tell compiler where to find png.h
	    LDFLAGS  = -L/usr/local/lib -lpng     # Link with libpng.dylib

	    TARGET = main

	    SRCS = main.cc

	    $(TARGET): $(SRCS)
		    $(CXX) $(SRCS) $(CXXFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(TARGET)

	    clean:
		    rm -f $(TARGET)

5.) What is a struct?

    Answer: A struct is an object with no methods where all of its data is public and 
    functions are created that take a struct as an argument creating a "poor man's" object 
    oriented programming technique.
