Chapter 11: Templates, Short Answer Questions (1, 2, 5, 7, 8) -

1.) What is a template?

    Answer: A template holds classes and functions with unspecified data types so that it can
    be used at a later time where the known data types can be placed in. 

2.) What is the fundamental difference between how Java and C++ implement collections?
    
    Answer: Java implements collections with a special framework that has an iterator that will
    iterate through collections while C++ uses a set of template classes called STL that is a 
    library of container classes with iterators. 

5.) What is an iterator?

    Answer: Iterators are classes that act as the current element or pointer that allows you
    to step through your elements. 

7.) What is the difference between the meaning of angle brackets (<>) in a Java generic and in
    a C++ template instantiation?
    
    Answer: Angle brackets in Java are used for type checking so the compiler can auto cast 
    at compile time while angle brackets in C++ are for creating new classes for custom 
    written types.

8.) Why can't you store references in a container?
    
    Answer: References can't be stored in containers because they are not objects so they can't
    be reassigned or uninitialized.
